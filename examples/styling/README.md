Styling Examples
=================

This folder contains demonstration pages for styling select options using the Smilodon packages.

Prerequisites
-------------

You should build the local packages before opening the demo files so the examples can import the built ESM bundles:

```bash
# from repo root
npm run ws:build:core
npm run build:react    # if you want the React example
npm run build:vue      # if you want the Vue example
```

How to run
----------

Serve the `examples/styling` directory from the repo root (so relative imports resolve). For a quick static server you can use `npx http-server` or `npm i -g serve`:

```bash
# from repo root
npx http-server -c-1 .
# or
npx serve .
```

Open one of the example pages in your browser:

- http://localhost:8080/examples/styling/plain.html
- http://localhost:8080/examples/styling/react.html
- http://localhost:8080/examples/styling/vue.html

Notes
-----

- The examples import the local `packages/*/dist/index.js` bundles. Building is required because the dist files are generated by the workspace build pipeline.
- The examples use lightweight adapter tags (`smilodon-react-select`, `smilodon-vue-select`) as placeholders – the adapter packages register framework-specific entrypoints when built. If you rename adapter exports, adjust imports accordingly.
- The vanilla `plain.html` demonstrates per-item `style`, `className`, and an inline renderer string.

If you'd like, I can also:

- Wire these into the existing `playground/` Vite app so they're available in dev mode without building.
- Add screenshots and short screencast instructions to the README.
